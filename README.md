CinemaScout is here to help you find your favorite movie or TV show. With search and discover (a TMDB feature utilized through the /discover endpoint) users can find any show or film in TMDB's database.

Users can find details such as the title, release date, runtime, synopsis, a link to the original website, actors, and directors by clicking on any poster card.

CinemaScout uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to search films and TV shows. This app was built using Vite + React.

WARNING - TMDB has specific definitions for 'adult film'. While all adult films are filtered out on this website, results may include borderline 'adult films' that TMDB does not consider 'adult'. Filtering to remove these results coming soon.
